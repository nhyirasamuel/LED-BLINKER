# LED-BLINKER
This project demonstrates how to control a red LED using MicroPython on a microcontroller. The code toggles the LED connected to Pin 15 in an infinite loop, keeping it off for 1 second and on for 2 seconds. It's a simple example for beginners to learn about GPIO pin control and timing in MicroPython.
